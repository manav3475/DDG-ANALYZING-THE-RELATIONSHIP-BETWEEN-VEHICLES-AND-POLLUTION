# ANALYZING-THE-RELATIONSHIP-BETWEEN-VEHICLES-AND-POLLUTION
The project is “analyzing the relationship between pollution and vehicle registration” . In this project we focus on analyzing the relationship between pollution and vehicle registration in India. For the analysis we have taken 4 years of data that is from (2011-2014) of pollution reported and vehicle registration taken place across the 33 states of India. We will be analyzing the correlation between the components of pollutants and analyze the trends of rate of change of pollution taking place in each state and compare the pollution rates after classifying the states into 4 sectors North, South, East and West after comparing the classified sector using 4 years of data we will predict the next 6 years of data that’s from (2015-2020) and analyze the difference and changes that may take place during the upcoming six years in the country and visualize using maps. And to study the second phase of project we have taken data set of carbon emission of 16 major states in India for 6 years (2009-2014) and data of vehicle registration taken place from the year 2009-2015 and basis of that data we are going to predict the expected carbon emission which may take place during the year 2015. For conducting our study, we are using Linear Regression, Label Encoder algorithms and Tableau for visualization.
